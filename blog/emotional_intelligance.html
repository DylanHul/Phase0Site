    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to monitor ones feeling and emotions, and  using this to guide  yourself. It is self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills. What I have learnt from this is Emotional Intelligence can be taught as a skill. By being calm or using meditation to calm ones self, it helps achieve much more than just reducing stress. While working with others this effective helps teams work together and it helps leaders have more of a connection. I also found it interesting that Commanders in the Navy were found to be more effective with this connectivity with others than the Commanders without.</p>
