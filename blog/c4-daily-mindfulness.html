              <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>

              <p>I used what I had learnt from the mindfulness chapter and had a mindful conversation with my girlfriend. Often I am distracted by my surroundings or thinking of future tasks that I need to work on, so this really helped me be in the present while I was speaking with her. I felt this incredible clarity in thought, and could understand exactly what she was saying. I was able to effectively express my own feelings. My girlfriend loved having a “mindful conversation” with me - she said she felt that she had my complete attention.</p>

              <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5> 

                <p>Practicing mindfulness through training my insula (area in the brain that is involved in emotional intelligence) by intentionally focusing on one part of the body at a time. I tried this technique after watching the video chapter, finding myself very calm and focused after doing so.
