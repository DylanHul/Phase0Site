               <h5>What was the problem, and how did I solve it?</h5>

                <p>On Saturday, I got stuck on JavaScript while creating a loop. A loop is a mathematical equation which allows you to input variables, meaning you can make slight changes to the outcome. One way a loop can be used is for counting the number of clicks on different variables, which is what this particular task involved.
                I was blocked on writing the variable inputs for the loop. The solution was a simple change - deleting the statement ‘else’, and just using ‘if’ as a way to identify the variables.</p>

                <h5>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving methods as below.</h5>


                <p>Trying something - I have been using this problem solving method a lot. Sometimes this can be time-consuming, so I use numerous methods to solve the issue. 
                Reading error messages - This is useful as it defines where the problem is instantly. 
                Console.logging - This is quite useful when I make a small mistake or typo. 
                Googling - I do this often, and find it effective as long as I have defined the problem, and know the right question to ask. 
                Asking peers for help - I don’t really ask others as much as I should - I like to try solve problems on my own first. I have only come across one issue that I have needed others’ help on, but I am sure I will need to ask others in the future as the course gets more and more technical. 
                Rubber ducky method and pseudocode - I haven’t tried these methods as yet.
                Improving process with reflection - I find reflecting on the technical aspects very helpful as being able to explain concepts to a non-tech friend greatly assists in my own understanding.</p>
