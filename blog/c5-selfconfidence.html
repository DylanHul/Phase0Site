              <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>

              <p>Both Self Awareness and Mindfulness are part of our emotional intelligence. Self Awareness is how we recognise and are aware of our personal state of mind. Mindfulness is essentially the same thing, it is when we notice change occurring within our behaviour. Both of which are necessary to evaluate oneself and are a necessary step into changing the emotions that can arise and see situation from a new perspective.</p>

               <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>

              <p>Body Scanning  was an interesting experience, which was quite a helpful way to understand how to use meditation. I found myself being aware of the individual parts of my body, I believe that this practice is a wonderful way to enhance your minds ability to focus on situations.</p>


               <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
               
              <p>My Emotions are Not Me, is an interesting perspective and it is important way for us to view ourselves. This idea if not letting emotions dictate the outcome of  situation and making a conscious decision on whether or not to use emotion. This was what I found interesting from this chapter for the ability to calm yourself from overreacting, yet also understanding the importance of emotion. The justification to use them in some situations and not ‘bottling’ them up.</p>
