              <h5>how did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>

              <p>This process helps me stay on the path, rather than falling down the ‘rabbit hole’. I know while I was redesigning my page that I wasn’t going to perfect or exactly what I wanted. However I did reach a final result that I was pleased with and learnt a lot through the process.</p>
               
               <h5>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h5>

              <p>I thought that meditation was not allowing for any distractions and keeping the mind clear. However I learnt that distractions are in fact acknowledged and then you move on, not to dwell on them or to judge, but to acknowledge the distraction of any form and then move on.</p>

              <h5>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h5>
              <p>That meditation is like a Snow Globe, that you must allow the mind to clear and settle to return to the default state of happiness.</p>


              <h5> Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
               Any other musings?

              <p>Finding a alert and comfortable position, such as the lotus position. As being too comfortable and keeping your eyes closed may lead to sleep.</p>
