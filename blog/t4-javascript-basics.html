            <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>

              <p>HTML and CSS are more design tools, to create the style and layout of the site. whereas JavaScript takes the site to whole new level, it is a way for the user to interact with the site. Along with interaction it is a way to organise and display data and access the troves of data on the internet.</p>

              <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life?</h5>

              <p>Control Flow is quite simply the order that actions are completed. Such as you need to open the milk bottle before you can pour the milk.</p>

               <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</h5>

              <p>JavaScript allows us to access data from arrays using bracket notations that stores a series of information. Objects allow for more variables to be stored and to even hold several arrays inside the object.</p>

              <h5> Explain what functions are and why they are useful?</h5>

              <p>JavaScript allows for us to build ‘Functions’ that provide a way to set up a process. This process can then ‘Called’ on and used again and allowing to change a few variables. Essentially baking a cake but changing the ingredients.</p>
