              Unfortunately this week I haven't tried a particular time habit, but I guess  I tried without realising the idea of confidence in my own ability to be able to learn new techniques. "Prove it to yourself in small ways and you'll develop the confidence that you can improve." This Growth mindset is what I have been doing this past week, improving my own abilities bit by bit.

            I found interesting Frog's Habit and how by just changing a tiny part of ones routine, that this can lead to big change and improvements. By just doing small changes in your everyday life and each week add a few more of these small changes whatever it may be as long as I have the motivation, can create lasting effect.

            I have found refection quite useful this week. By looking back and seeing how much I've learnt, and how much faster I am at using a terminal to Push to Github and being surprised by how easy html was to pick up.
            </p>
            <p>
            I want to experiment with Frog's Tiny changes, and implement some changes in my own lifestyle. For instance this week a small change I've made is setting a routine for which I can set aside time to work each day. Next week I want to change the location of where I do that to make me more productive.
